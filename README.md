The project, titled "In-Vehicle Recommendations," spearheaded by a team consisting of Jennifer Baker, Yanjing Ren, Safrin Patil, Devan Kreitzer, Patrick Maggio, Sravani Yadavalli, and Rachana Nagaraj Banakar, focuses on leveraging predictive analytics to optimize coupon distribution in the competitive food services industry. Recognizing the significance of customer acquisition and retention, the team aims to avoid the negative impact of excessive coupon distribution on brand image. Their model, designed for a custom F2 score that emphasizes both recall and precision, seeks to predict likely users based on individual characteristics, thereby offering targeted and personalized coupon recommendations. The project draws inspiration from the substantial market potential in the $340 billion U.S. coffee industry and the $190 billion fast casual market, emphasizing the value of location services and existing customer data in delivering timely push notifications to increase sales.

The team's approach involves building upon a dataset sourced from a 2017 survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk, which was previously used by researchers to apply rule-set models for interpretable classification. In contrast to the "black box" methods commonly employed, the team seeks to develop a model that provides descriptive analytics, offering valuable insights for personalized recommendations and encouraging engagement with local products and services. By incorporating various sophisticated models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, Neural Networks, and XGBoost, the team aims to enhance predictive capabilities. The unique focus on optimizing the F2 score distinguishes their approach, prioritizing customers likely to redeem coupons while minimizing annoyance from bulk notifications. Ultimately, the team envisions creating an in-house app or selling the model to companies, providing a competitive advantage through intelligent and targeted advertising in the food servicesÂ industry.
